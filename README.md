## Start the app in dev mode

`npm start` starts the client (and opens it at `localhost:3000`)

`npm run server` starts the express server

## Start the app in production mode (enables the service worker)

`npm run build && npm run server`

The application will be available at `localhost:8080` (the server URL)
